# Introduction

VK-IO - This is a powerful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily interact with VK API using a simplified interface and its flexibility providing an abstraction layer over a standard API.

## What is it for?

- Almost 100% API coverage
- 100% based on Promise
- Fast and effective
- Multifunctional

## Prehistory

In the beginning, I needed a simple and convenient library for working with the API, but every time I tried a new library, it was often uncomfortable or simply not updated for a couple of years. So it was born `vk-io` that took into account all these inconveniences and fixed them on the vine.
